It's got some compelling evidence and snippets of the moon landing where, after going over how Scotchlite tape works, you can arguably see the same effect along the background of the scene.I, too, seriously believe we were moon landing capable back then. But that doesn't change the fact we had motivations to appear to the public eye as the first on the moon. After watching that doc (Just Google the name and you can watch it free in a couple diff places online) I certainly have a few more questions and are more skeptical at least. Like I said, it's compelling, and it's entire premise is simply filmmaking strategies so it's not like it starts off proclaiming the earth is flat or anything lol. Edit: If you don't want to watch it, here's a pretty good synopsis you can read if you please. Www.reddirtreport.com/general/film-review-kubricks-odyssey-jay-weidner",

Şimdi ise daha saldırgan olan Green Terror ve Jaguar cichlid eklemesi yaptım. Durum biraz ironik görünse de, Jaguar'ı diğerlerinden küçük olduğu için aldım ve kendisi çok sakin; en azından şimdilik. Green Terror'ü ise u/Atilcelik arkadaşım doğum günü hediyesi olarak getirdi, her zaman çok istediğim ve özendiğim bir balıktı. Şimdilik bir sorun yok, Astronotla Green terror ufak bir dalaşma yaşadı ama Astronot uslu durdukça Green kimseye dokunmuyor.İsimlerini de meşhur film karakterlerinden koydum.    ",

But, there's another way to maintain your altitude.Let's take you a little bit higher (so it's easier to visualize) and release you from a few hundred thousand kilometers away.  Obviously, there's still gravity out here, so you'd plummet toward the earth.  However, rather than just dropping you, launch you side ways, really fast!Well, you'd still plummet toward the earth (gavity's gravity after all).  But, the gravity would be trying to over come your initial speed.  As you feel toward the earth, you'd continue to move sideways.  If I threw you fast enough, gravity wouldn't be able to pull you in, and you'd miss the earth entirely.If I threw you just hard enough, though, you'd miss the earth, but gravity would have also deflected your path quite a bit (a whole 90 degrees!).  Gravity canceled out that initial push I started you with, but all that falling you've done has given you a new speed, in a new direction.  But gravity is now pulling sideways to that new speed (because you moved around to the side of the planet).  So the whole thing repeats again... and again... and again!  You're actually using the planet's own gravity to stay up there!  We call this effect an orbit!",

                        "text": "Secondly density will cause the object in question to fall if the volume occupied is less dense.Nope. Density has nothing to do with the direction of motion. There has to be some other force giving a direction to the motion. Dense objects fall toward the center of mass because of gravity. No gravity, no falling.Consider this: In a lab we set up a sphere of water containing within it a small balloon of much less dense gas. What happens if the balloon is above the center of the sphere when it is released? It \"floats\" away from the center... right? So that could be because the balloon is less dense than the water and the water is pushing it to the surface, trying to move it out of the water.Now we do the same thing but release the balloon below the center of the sphere. This time it \"floats\" toward the center of the sphere of water, initially becoming deeper within the sphere.How does this work? If the more dense water is pushing the balloon to the surface, it should push it away from the center... right? So why does the opposite happen?It happens because in reality all the water in the sphere is trying to fall towards the center of mass, which on earth is the center of the earth. The water is \"falling\" towards the center because gravity is pulling on it with a strength relative to its density. The less dense balloon is also being pulled to the center of the earth, but less strongly. This causes the balloon to float to the top of the sphere, no matter where it is released.The direction the balloon moves is solely governed by the direction of gravity, and has nothing to do with density.If the gas in the balloon is less dense than water, but more dense than air, the balloon will rise until it reaches the less dense air, then will simply sit there, because gravity stops it from moving any higher. If the gas in the balloon is less dense than air then it will keep rising until it is high enough above the earth that the density of air is less than the density of the gas within it, and then it will just sit there.At no point does gravity stop working on it, and the only reason it floated up to that altitude is because gravity was working more strongly on the air around it.Put simply - no gravity, no buoyancy.",

                        "text": "TL;DR: The ISS is under the effect of gravity, about 90% of surface gravity.  However, as they fall, they keep missing the earth.  This gives the illusion of weightlessness.Astronauts are under the effect of gravity, and it's about 90% the strength we feel here at the surface (gravity gets weaker the farther away you are from an object).  That means if you suddenly teleported to the altitude of the ISS, you'd start falling at about 9 meters per second per second.  In fact, this is about how fast the ISS is falling toward the Earth as we speak.  So, why hasn't it crashed, and why do the astronauts seem to float?If you've ever been in free fall (like on a roller coaster, or one of those reduced gravity planes) you'll know you can get the feeling of being without gravity quite easily.  Let's take a look at those planes.  The basically fly up really high, then allow themselves to free fall back to earth for a little while, before flying back up to do it again.If we look more closely at their flight path, however, we'll see something odd.  The part were you stop feeling gravity actually starts while the plane is still going upward!Think about it this way: we know you're in free fall if you only have the force of gravity acting on you.  No engines from a ship, no ground holding you up, etc.  If the plane is heading upward, then shuts off their engines, they still have their upward momentum that has to be canceled out first, before they start falling downward.  But, the moment they cut off their engines, they are in free fall; the plane is only under the effect of gravity.So how does this apply to the astronauts?  Well, the ISS doesn't have any engines holding up there, so they are free falling too.  Why haven't they crashed yet?  The ISS is also moving sideways very fast as well.  As it falls, it is moving sideways.  It's moving sideways so fast (7 kilometers per second), the earth actually curves away before it would hit the ground.So, the astronauts are under the effect of gravity, but everything around them is too.  It looks like they aren't because all the stuff around them is plummeting toward the earth as well.",

The effects of microgravity can be seen when astronauts and objects float in space. Microgravity can be experienced in other ways, as well. \"Micro-\" means \"very small,\" so microgravity refers to the condition where gravity seems to be very small. In microgravity, astronauts can float in their spacecraft - or outside, on a spacewalk. Heavy objects move around easily. For example, astronauts can move equipment weighing hundreds of pounds with their fingertips. Microgravity is sometimes called \"zero gravity,\" but this is misleading.\"",

You have to maintain balance and they can't do that in a vacuum where they are subject to the gravity of larger objects in space. They can't propel themselves with thrusters in space.",

And more from NASA:\"If 90 percent of Earth's gravity reaches the space station, then why do astronauts float there? The answer is because they are in free fall. In a vacuum, gravity causes all objects to fall at the same rate. The mass of the object does not matter. If a person drops a hammer and a feather, air will make the feather fall more slowly. But if there were no air, they would fall at the same acceleration. Some amusement parks have free-fall rides, in which a cabin is dropped along a tall tower. If a person let go of an object at the beginning of the fall, the person and the object would fall at the same acceleration. Because of that, the object would appear to float in front of the person. That is what happens in a spacecraft. The spacecraft, its crew and any objects aboard are all falling toward but around Earth. Since they are all falling together, the crew and objects appear to float when compared with the spacecraft\"",

To add a little more on this cake, you should be aware that black matter has been disproved. Which means is \"Space\" is truly a translucent void. Most likely being pushed along side the galaxy, or large cosmic object moving. Ideally our very reality hinged on something becoming so dense that it broke threw a bottom layer funneling all of matter into this cosmic sink hole.

Everyone on earth should be attracted to the sun by its own fallacy. The earth would be absorbed by the sun's gravity especially since it attracts larger planets farther out, like Jupiter.  But comets should tell you that the gravity field spans billions of miles  out, as soon as the space ship left the gravity of earth it would be pulled to the sun. If any of this made sense.",

Wouldn't it make more sense to use the same technique for the spacewalk shots, especially when they know that people are onto them? You could use the argument that now that people are starting to notice the air bubbles, they can't stop filming them in fear of revealing themselves, but these air bubbles are quite infrequent. Also, if they're using green screens, they could still just add in a few bubbles here and there, even if they're not in the pool.So in short, the air bubbles argument is very thin, and it makes much more sense that the shots are in fact real, and that Scott Kelly is telling the truth about their nature here.",

Then, any bubbles would appear to rush at the camera, instead of floating upward.

Its a fact that upwards rising bubblesIf they are really underwater, there should be many bubbles and not just one isolated bubble once every 10 hours of footage. So this means that they need to remove the bubbles using CGI. This is another difficulty of filming underwater.So there needs to be extra benefits to film underwater to compensate that extra work. What exactly is it ?oxygen tanks (like the ones used by scuba divers),Well, in theory, there is no air in space. So oxygen tanks makes perfect sense. I would be much more suspicious if they showed someone without an oxygen tank in space ...and swimming pool lights What is a \"swimming pool light\" ? In what way is it different from a regular light ? Again, in theory, there is no light in space when they are on the nightside of Earth, so they will need some lightsource to work outside ...NASA realizes that we flat earthers exposed their BS, so now they are going to be extra careful to double check footage for bubbles, and edit them outSo if there is no bubbles anymore in future footage, it will be a proof that you were right ?

That and the fact that some of the stuff he plays is so insane that I would understand if people first hearing this would assume they used a drum machine lol.",

                        "text": "Jojo Mayer & Nerveartist pic Drummer Jojo Mayer initiated Nerve in spring '98 as an experimental platform for a handful of New York musicians interested in the current stream of electronic music styles in DJ culture such as \"drum and bass\", nu skool breaks, nu-jazz, abstract funk, electro break beats etc., trying to detect and explore recent developments in \"intelligent\" electronic dance music.His basic idea was to reverse engineer the textures and rhythms of contemporary digital production within a live performed context. Live drums, bass, keyboards and live interactive sound processing - no loops, sequencers, or pre- production. All sounds are performed in real time!By cross-pollinating DJ culture with the syntax of jazz interaction and utilizing sound processing techniques usually applied in studio productions (real time audio deconstruction), Nerve has been formulating a highly skilled, kinetic and dynamic hybrid of improvisational performed music, which is completely unique to this date.Within a few months of its existence, Jojo Mayer's Nerve has generated a tremendous amount of enthusiastic response among New York's downtown scene and the media, which led to the creation of \"Prohibited Beatz\", a multimedia party/event which has established itself as the prime platform of this movement.Nerve's current core line up consists of Jojo Mayer (drums, beats), Tacuya Nakamura (synths, sampler, trumpet),  John Davis (bass and low frequency manipulation) and Roli Mosimann (real time audio deconstruction).

Of course, switch pedals if you want, but new pedals won't make you faster. They'll just get in the way less. Exhaust your setup options with your pedal.",

Unfortunately, The Deauville Hotel suffered damage from a fire and from the hurricane and will not be re-opened in time for GroundUP this year, so your reservation must be moved to a different hotel.  GroundUP has partnered with a wonderful hotel about 20 blocks down the street from the Deauville (a 5 minute drive), the oceanfront Miami Beach Resort and Spa, to host its artists as well as the GroundUP guests who have already booked reservations at the Deauville Hotel (as well as to host GroundUP’s Late Night Shows in their awesome spaces with views overlooking the city and ocean where Frank Sinatra used to play, back in the day!).  The room rates at the Miami Beach Resort and Spa are higher, but since you have already booked your reservation at the Deauville, the Miami Beach Resort and Spa will honor the same room rate that you had at the Deauville Hotel. In order to move your reservation to the Miami Beach Resort and Spa, you need to take action on or before 5 PM EST on January 6, 2018. There are very few rooms remaining at the Miami Beach Resort and Spa, so the hotel must receive your request to move your reservation, and get your credit card information, by this date.If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to email me back or call. Also, please send me a confirmation that you received this email.We look forward to seeing you in February!Warmly,The GroundUP Team",

Any lack of alternating be it bounces, doubles, or anything else would then not be single strokes. It's fast, he uses his fingers, there's no trickery. Everyone likes to think there is a trick or shortcut but there simply is not. Optimize how you play, learn to get out of the way of bounce, you'll be faster. Practice, you'll get faster.

With all techniques, you have to solve a basic problem: How do you get the stick back up off what you hit? When there is no rebound, you have to lift it. When there is rebound, you have to get out of the way. The difference is in the amount of energy you expend getting the stick back into playing position. If you look at the Chapin video I linked, you can see him lift the stick after the stroke on the slow strokes. As he gets faster, he lets the stick do more of the work, this isn't all there is to the Moeller stroke, just the one simple motion of it. Analysing that motion, you can see that as you increase speed your hand stops lifting the stick and starts trying to get out of the way of it. Jojo Mayer explains this in one of his modern drummer performances, that letting the stick rebound is how you get that fast. You have to get out of the way, but not waste energy picking it back up. In trad grip, you actually use your other fingers to kick the stick back up off the surface when doing a controlled stroke. They are the same techniques, but he has to pick the stick up instead of letting it come back on its own.-Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and I'll be needing an attendant, so-- Oh, I'm sorry.

Jim Chapin explains it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yNb-kUPwMIHis other techniques use fingers and upstrokes like the Moeller stroke. The reality is he does controlled strokes (no rebound) and controlled bounce (with rebound) and he's able to switch between the two flawlessly.-Now we all love Nibbler, so it's only fair that we all pitch in and clean it up together. Still, I propose we make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?-",

Sheds parts: The nuts from the bottom of the spring, the little plastic pads from the hoop clamp, the rubber no-skid pad from the baseplate.The special \"ballistic fiber\" strap breaks, even with lighter playing, after only a few months.The carrying case is flimsy and rips apart quickly.Sonor USA got bought by some larger music gear entity (maybe Harmon?) a couple of years ago and my local drum shop is unable to get replacement parts for it, despite being a Sonor dealer.The hoop clamp is an integral part of the folding/locking mechanism and you must set its height (the width of the gap, when in the locked position) precisely for each hoop you attach it to. Just a hair too loose and the main upright arm wobbles, weakening your stroke while making a clicking sound. A hair too tight and that arm never fully locks into position, which you might not notice until midway into the first tune when the entire upright arm starts swinging instead of the beater as you press on the pedal. Everyone in the audience will notice the look on your face, and they won't have to be skilled lip-readers to know that you're in trouble.It is light and the detachable spring is cool, which is how you'll look as you fold the pedal flat in a single smooth motion after your gig. When the hoop clamp is properly adjusted, the pedal motion is smooth and practically silent. The round cam will give you constant beater acceleration as you press the pedal down, which is a bit of a taste thing but I personally dig it. My biggest problem with it was that I always felt the need to bring a backup pedal to gigs. After a while I just stopped bringing the Jojo pedal, though it continues to perform admirably on my drumset at home.",

Bu enerji, fotonlar haricinde yüksek eylemliliğe sahip, bozunum sağlamış nükleer yakıttan yayılan nötron, elektron, protonların inanılmaz hızda hareketiyle de sağlanabilir (genelde bizim açımızdan esas tehlikeli olan da bunlar).

Fakat o \"nükleer atık\" diye adlandırılan, aslen bozunumu devam eden fakat yüksek değerini yitirmiş yakıt çubuğu da enerji yaymaya devam eder, yaydığı enerji yeni yakıt çubuğundan az olduğu için çıkarılıp atılır.Bizi ilgilendiren kısım ise şu, Rusya bize \"atıkları ben toplayacağım, fakat sen toplama dersen istediğin yere de bırakırım\" dedi.

Sistem bozuldu, eh ne yapacağız? Haydi Moskova'ya mesaj atalım belki yedek parça vardır. /s3- Eh bir zahmet o da olsun artık hani. Bütün işi bitiren sistem o olyuor çünkü.4- SA-11 veya SA-15 gibi tam mobil değil ancak istenen yerde hızla kurulabilmesi (Yanlış hatırlamıyorsam 3-5 dakika içinde atışa hazır konuma geliyor) bir durum var.5- Eğer böyle bir madde olsaydı zaten bütün olay baştan patlardı.6- Hangi füzeleri alıyoruz? Kısa 125km menzilli olanları mı? Böyle sisteme o füzeleri almak pek mantıklı değil bence, ama işi bilenler kararı vermiş. /s7- Hiç bir ülke (Özellikle Rusya) bu zamanda istediği vakit yok edemeyeceği malzemeyi başkasına satmaz. Adam havyarı bile bu mantıkla satar.8- NATO ağına bağlanması sorun değil, aldığımız vakit NATO sıraya dizilecek içini dışını görmek için, o asıl sorun. Ama \"monkey model\" mantığı burada Rusya'nın işine yarar, çünkü sattıkları malzeme dışsatıma yönelik değiştirilmiş bir versiyon.9- IADS olayında bu kadar yüksek potansiyel malzeme pek az kullanılır. Ama düzgün kullanılırsa önüne geleni deşer.10- O konuda sıkıntı olacağını sanmam, ama kim bilir?11- He yavrum, A-235 Nudol sistemini de beraber üretelim? /s12- Balistik füze savuması için üç unsura ihtiyaç vardır; kesin vuruş olmasa bile hedefi yok edebilecek bir savunma sistemi, hedefi \"terminal descent\" sırasında izleyebilecek bir keşif sistemi, ve hedefi \"boost phase\" sırasında algılayabilecek bir takip sistemi. Bizde ne yazık ki hiç birini karşılayacak sistem daha hâla yok. S-400'ün de birinci aşamayı (savunma sistemi) karşılaması bayağı şüpheli.13- S-400'ün kendi radar ekipmanı göremese bile eğer seyir füzelerini görebilecek bir sistem ile datalink paylaşımı olursa belki olabilir. Uçaklarda bu durum biraz daha kolay ama yerde iş çok zor.14- Oraya girmeye cesaretim yok, radar işi çok önemli, çok detay var, kafam şimdi basmıyor zaten. Pas.15- Radar ne kadar düşük frekanslı ve ne kadar gelen radar bilgisini adam gibi algılayabiliyorsa o kadar çabuk şekilde bir \"stealth\" uçak tanımlanabilir. Sanırsam Rusya bunun için Nebo-SVU diye, S-400 sistemi dışında bir malzeme kullanıyor. Bakmak lazım.16- Biz Vietnam'mıyız? /s17- Çin'in teknolojik çöp (hem lafın gelişi hem de gerçek anlamda) satmak gibi bir alışkanlığı var, bir ara biz de oltaya takıldık ama kurtulduk işin içinden. Rus'un pisliğini Çin'in adam gibi sattığına tercih ederim, teşekkürler.Günün sonunda, aldığımız S-400 türlü türlü pislik detayın olduğu bir alay konusuna dönüşmese şanslıyız.",
