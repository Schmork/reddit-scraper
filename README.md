# reddit-scraper
This is a fork. The original reddit-scraper (including documentation and how-to) is available at https://github.com/utkuufuk/reddit-scraper

This fork is meant for census purposes: Automatically count how many users on a given subreddit have a certain flair, and possibly relate comment ratings to that.
